The aim of this project is to create a concise javascript codebase for a browser-based graphics engine.
Since there seems to be only a few webpages out there on the web dedicated to 3D graphics using WebGL, I realized that this project needed to be done. 

From watching various videos on the web and researching the capabilities of javascript and WebGL, I have come to the conclusion that WebGL applications have the ability run almost as fast as their desktop counterparts. It's an exciting prospect to think that 3D graphics can be done just as well on a browser as it can as a standalone application. Just ponder for a moment what it would be like to replace all of your favorite 2D flash games with fully interactive 3D environments. If programmers can start to understand OpenGL clones and the basics of creating games using them, there will surely be an outburst of silly wonderful games that are more powerful and more wonderful to experience.

Below I list the features that I have implemented so far:
-Basic camera controls
-Randomized landscape generation
-Forward shading
-Deferred rendering

Here are some possible features that I have yet to implement:
-World generator
-Physics
-Partical effects
-Shadows
-Actual game logic

I will be continually updating this project as I discover more and more features that WebGL is cabable of.
